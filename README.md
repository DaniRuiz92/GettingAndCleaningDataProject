# Getting and Cleaning Data - Coursera
## Final Project

## Files
The R script __run_analysis.R__ does the following operations:

1. Downloads the raw data
2. Extracts the raw data
3. Reads the raw data (Train and Test)
4. Selects mean and standard deviation data
5. Merges the Train and Test data
6. Sets activity and subject as factors
7. Computes mean for each variable for subject and activity data
8. Writes a .txt called "tidy.txt" with the tidy data

__tidy.txt__ is the file created by the R script

The __Codebook.md__ file describes the data set variables
